## riv-judge
The general purpose of this program is to check the correctness of your solution for a particular algorithmic problem through verifying your program with a set of generated test data. Moreover this program can verify different solutions for different problems.
The program support two types of test data:
1. The first type is about test data which are pre-generated. This means you have already created offline a set of inputs and corresponding outputs to test your program.
2. The other type is that you have a generator to generate online the test data for checking.
Another decent feature of this program is that you can customize the structure of set of your problems as well as the structure of set of your solutions.
